# Project 2
**Title:** Customer Insight - Data Manipulation And Interrogation

**SQL Code:** [Customer Insight - SQL Codes](https://github.com/Fadaramaja/Fadaramaja.github.io/blob/main/Customer.sql)

![Customer_sql.png](Customer_sql.png)

**SQL Skills Used:** 
- Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
- Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
- Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
- Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval

**Project Description:** 
This project focused on analysing customer and sales data to generate actionable insights that support business decision-making. Using SQL Server, I designed and executed queries to extract, manipulate, and interrogate data from multiple relational tables, including Customers, Orders, and Salesman.

The project involved building reports that combined customer demographics, order details, purchase amounts, and salesman performance to understand sales trends and customer behaviour. Queries were designed to:

- Retrieve customer and order information, including city, order date, and purchase amount.

- Analyze orders by status to evaluate fulfilment efficiency.

- Identify customers without assigned sales representatives for potential sales opportunities.

- Join salesmen and customer data to analyse commission structures and their impact on sales.

- Aggregate purchase amounts and order counts to assess overall sales performance across regions and time periods.

Through this data interrogation, the project highlighted patterns in customer purchases, identified gaps in sales coverage, and provided insights into improving sales strategies.


**Technology used:** SQL server
